I began contacting WFB whom my home loan is with, for assitance and options. \\nIn early XX/XX/XXXX I began the Loan Modification process with Wells Fargo Bank. I was told that they would not assist me with anything financial on my home loan until I fell 90 days behind, though at the time I started to inquire for assistance from WFB I was only a few weeks behind. So, I began working with a program called XXXX. They approved me for a variety of assistence and reached out to Wells Fargo Bank to determine what they could assist with. Wells Fargo then turned down the assistance from XXXX and finally offered to do a Loan Modification for me. The outcome was totally unknow about what I would be offered in the end by WFB for assistance. Wells Fargo lost my paperwork twice during this process, so it took 2 months from the time I started to the time my paperwork began to be processed for some kind of approval. In XX/XX/XXXX I was in a trial period of 3 months of payments based on a slightly modified amount. Roughly {$75.00} less than what I was paying on my original payment. However, my caseworker with WFB, failed to tell me that since the payments during this time were not the full amount of the original mortgage payment so they were not applied to the loan. I discovered this in XX/XX/XXXX when I was told by a creditor with XXXX that she could n't restore my line of credit because of something to do with my mortgage. I then called and found this out. My caseworker at WFB then told me it was n't her responsibility to tell me this information. I told her that she could have told me that if I could come up with the remaining amount of {$75.00} then the payments would be applied. Instead, she chose to withhold this information and damage my credit even further. Now we are into 5 months ( including the 90 days WFB told me I had to fall behind until they would help me ) without an applied payment to my home loan, going on 6 months. \\nMore paperwork was lost in XXXX as the modification was being finalized and my loan modification did n't go through until XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke to a lawyer that is working on a class-action lawsuit against WFB for people in a similar situation and said this paper loss is typical. \\nWells Fargo did not reduce the interest rate, but they did reduce the payment by less than {$100.00} and the payments I was behind went back into the loan. \\nMy property taxes also fell behind in my escrow account at this time because there was no payment on the loan. So, I am behind on my property taxes, have damaged credit, and and I am not in any better payment situation than I was. \\nThey can not give me a reason on why they rejected XXXX assistance. I was originally told they were not an approved agency but on a later phone call to Wells Fargo Bank I was told that they work with that program often and the WFB employee could not understand why they would reject the help. I also spoke with XXXX and they said that Wells Fargo works with this program all the time and could n't understand why they would do this. \\nI feel that I have been taken advantage of by Wells Fargo and would like to pursue legal action against them based on negligence. \\nAlthough my payments are back on track I am not making much more money now than I was before so it is only a matter of time before something like this happens again if something unforeseen happens to my life that affects my finances. \\n\",\n"," 'I have an open and current mortgage with Chase Bank # XXXX.

I was told that I would be getting a good deal on the vehicles in which i purchased. I later found out that the interest rate charged for the loans at the time was almost XXXX times that of the average consumer for the credit score that I had and when I came back to speak to the finance manager. The dealership had let her go for fudging many of the loans and jacking up many customers interest in order to make a higher commission and she was no longer employed with the company due to her increasing many loans on the interest that some of their consumers were paying. The dealership as of today 's date has never contacted me and had i not inquired I would have never known the truth. When I applied my credit score was showing XXXX approximately and thought that I would get the lowest interest rate at the dealership offered but instead I received an interest rate that was nearly XXXX of that of the regular consumer. I am requesting an investigation on the lending of loans and services of this company based on the following Discrimination based on race, and color, gender for I was charged a higher rate than other consumers of a different race, gender or color I request an immediate investigation on the loans that were processed during the time that I applied and it will show this to be a everyday factor practice based on race and to investigate the transactions of this company and how they are advertising a certain price and then selling their vehicles for more than the advertised price. It is like a bait and switch on the consumer. Predatory lending has clearly been an everyday factor in order for the finance department to make a better commissions on the consumer who is not aware of how the process works. I was charged a higher rate for no reason other than greed. Fair and accurate transaction was not taken into account by dealership. Equal credit opportunity act has been was not taken into account. Gramm leach biley act was not taken into account. After purchasing the vehicle I was called back into the office to sign more paperwork again after the vehicle was in my possession for more than a month.

I never got the discount on my vehicles and the price of the vehicles was sold for more than they advertised which I later found out from the XXXX ledger. I am still trying to figure out where is the discount and why was I charged a higher interest rate and why did the finance manager deliberately fudge my loan. consumers of a different race who have purchased from this dealership have lower interest rates than mine with lower credit scores than what I had when I purchased my vehicle. As of today 's date their is no discount, higher interest rate, higher price paid for vehicles and the military rate was applied later and went somewhere else for all I know.

Prior to the sell, I had never heard of this company. As a result of the sell Green Tree opened an escrow account, to pay property taxes and insurance, I never had a escrow account before and do not believe the State of California requires lenders to maintain an escrow account. My mortgage is a fixed rate 30+ year mortgage and the monthly mortgage payment is {$1200.00} and I pay $ XXXX monthly to cover the escrow payment for property taxes and insurance. According to my monthly statement from Green Tree, my regular monthly payment is {$1500.00} so I pay roughly {$11.00} per month more than is required which I acknowledge was no designated to be applied to the escrow account until I recently made my XXXX payment. Despite my attempts to comply with the terms of this loan, every year since Green Tree has held our mortgage we get a bill for XXXX of dollars, this year it was {$800.00}, supposedly because of escrow shortages. Every year it \\'s a different amount, but the escrow shortages are always for XXXX of dollars and the amount of insurance and property taxes we pay annually does not increase that much to justify these increases of XXXX of dollars each year. Green Tree provides this annual escrow account disclosure statement with this convoluted calculation to justify these increases ( copy attached ). This year XXXX days prior to receiving the annual escrow account disclosure statement we received a letter from Green Tree stating that our account was current ( copy attached ). Each year I contact Green Tree to get someone to explain these calculations and I have yet to understand the justification or the explanation. If you do n\\'t pay the amount of the shortage Green Tree threatens to increase the amount of your regular monthly payment to cover the shortage. I find it hard to believe it is legal for a mortgage company to charge a borrower XXXX of dollars more per year to maintain an escrow account if it \\'s cheaper for the borrower to pay their own property taxes and insurance. If the borrower \\'s property taxes and insurance are not delinquent, then a borrower should be able to opt out of such a onerous escrow arrangement. If Green Tree is able to charge people XXXX of dollars more each year for these \" supposed escrow shortages \\'\\' it \\'s no wonder they require borrowers to have an escrow account. We should be able to pay our own property taxes and insurance to avoid the financial hardship that Green Tree is creating. We are currently stuck with this mortgage company, but at the first opportunity we will make every effort to change lenders. But I do n\\'t believe we should be penalized because we are stuck with this company. A company we did not voluntarily enter into a contract with. It should not be legal for a mortgage company to require consumers to have an escrow account that costs them hundreds of dollars more per year than it would cost if that consumer paid their own property taxes and insurance. I do n\\'t know if this practice is legal but it should n\\'t be and it definitely needs to be investigated. \\n',\n"," \"Ocwen loan servicing is the servicer of my loan. \\n1.

Remuneration can not restore the years of damage done to my credit, nor retrieve the expenditure of time lost in arguing my case with the loan guarantor and originator, nor mitigate the stress, but the monies rightfully belong to me and should be returned. \\n\\nThe following is an excerpt from XXXX of the letters I submitted to ECMC : In XXXX, after being notified by my employer that my wages were to be garnished for student loans I never applied for, from colleges I never attended, I called the guarantor of the loans and spoke with a representative that offered no alternative but a repayment plan or a prolongation of wage garnishment ( though I vehemently informed the representative I was not the responsible party, had no knowledge of said loans and was not even living in California at the time the student loans were opened ). I initially refused to pay for the loans, and in turn, monies were taken from my salary and tax refunds. I was young and uninformed. It seemed I had no recourse in the matter. I finally and begrudgingly acquiesced, in XXXX XXXX, to entering a rehabilitation program for the fraudulently filed loans when yet again, after filing my taxes, another {$430.00} was taken from me as an IRS offset. Not until this year, after having upwards of nine thousand dollars taken from me, did I learn I could file for discharge due to id theft. And even now, after submitting all I can, ECMC continues to keep this matter unresolved.

Unscrupulous salespersons contacted my mom many times to get her to refinance her house at a rate she could not afford and terms she could never repay. She purchased her home in XX/XX/XXXX for {$25000.00}, and houses in her area are currently appraised in the $ 55,000- {$75000.00} range. Mom finally relented and agreed to the refinance XX/XX/XXXX, 15 months after she had suffered a debilitating stroke, when she especially needed any extra money to offset healthcare costs. The loan amount was for {$180000.00} ( based on a grossly inflated appraisal ), and it appears Mom \\'s income was fabricated to qualify for the loan. It is an adjustable rate mortgage, with an above market start rate of 7.35 %, but it could ONLY go up because 7.35 % was also the floor for the mortgage. To make matters worse, the loan had a five percent pre-payment penalty during the first two years. The loan also had a 40 year amortization schedule, but was for a 30 year term, meaning that Mom would have a substantial balloon payment of over {$100000.00} due in XX/XX/XXXX, when she would be almost XXXX years old. Mom tells me that she contacted Wells Fargo on a number of occasions to seek a loan modification. Each time Mom says that her paperwork would be lost by Wells Fargo, or she says that additional documentation was requested ( even though Mom believes the documents were previously submitted, multiple times ). At one point, a representative told Mom that she was ineligible for a modification because her loan was current. When she finally fell behind, she says she was told that she was not eligible for a modification because her loan was in default. Mom says her multiple requests for a modification were never approved, yet she believes that she never received any kind of acceptable explanation as to the basis for the denial. At this point, she will very likely lose the home she has had retrofitted with a number of items that help Mom function more normally, such as pull up bars and other items that compensate for her XXXX and assist her with every day activities.

The practice of requiring personal DOB and SSN for provision of small business merchant services is discriminatory against a properly formulated business, represents an unnecessary burden not applied to large entities, and is particularly galling because in the specific case merchant services, contorts the entire process SINCE THE DIRECTION OF MONEY FLOW IS FROM THE BANK ( XXXX ) TO THE SMALL BUSINESS. Given this money flow reality, conducting a personal credit check is not only discriminatory and abusive, but fraudulent, since there is no provision of credit arising from performance of the credit review, notwithstanding the rare circumstance of a charge-back, which for the undersigned complainant has never occurred in 14 years of accepting credit cards.

Web banking was seemingly constantly undergoing updates and changes so it was very hard to access my account on line. 7 : THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INSANE!

They would tell me that they would make note of it and the call would end. I received these calls XXXX or XXXX a month during the forbearance period, and worse, so did my cosigners.

Still recovering from the impact of XXXX XXXX and a direct strike from a XXXX born out of the storm, the Mortgage Crisis was beginning. Michigan XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX and finally Ocwen, each, took over my home loan. \\nSomewhere in the process my loan was put into a 30-year fixed loan. That was the good news. \\nBut, despite my pleas to handle my property tax and hazard premium payment myself, Ocwen demanded escrowing the funds. My town - XXXX XXXX, LA - requires property tax payments at the beginning of the year instead of year-end, like most municipalities. Despite repeated letters to Ocwen, my property taxes began accruing interest and penalties, and finally, after many years of letter writing warning Ocwen about the potential problem, I discovered Ocwen had n't even been paying my property taxes at all. And, my home and property were sold at a Tax Sale. ( attachment ) Only last month, in XX/XX/XXXX, did I finally find a change to my escrow account on Ocwen 's webpage. The glaring and abrupt increase in my escrow account and the increase in my monthly mortgage payment were tell-tale signs something had changed for the worse. \\nAnd, to make matters worse, my home suffered a total loss from a fire on XX/XX/XXXX. A plug-in fragrance and night light device was the cause. \\nBut, already losing my home and most of my possessions to this fire, I was forced to continue arguing with Ocwen Loan Servicing about the Delinquent Tax Bills they had not paid, but they had escrowed my payments for over the years. In other words, they took my payments for XXXX XXXX, but Ocwen did n't pay the taxes. \\nThen, the last straw was laid upon my already stressed existence. Ocwen withheld proceeds from my Hazard Premium for over thirty days from receipt of my funds. Ocwen played game after game slowing the release of even one dollar to help me rebuild my home. Had it not been for an XXXX, we would have suffered nearly 90-days with nothing. Still today, I have to argue constantly with Ocwen to release funds for reconstruction. And with 92 % of the work complete, only 66 % of the funds have been released. Today is XX/XX/XXXX. The XXXX was XX/XX/XXXX. Nearly seven months and still Ocwen withholds funds. About three weeks ago, Ocwen Loss Department called me to inquire about my percentage of completion of construction from the fire. We agreed they should send an inspector right away. The inspector showed up last week, but she forgot to bring the paperwork. Three days later she emailed me requesting I print he email, sign the form, scan the document and email it back. Perhaps, not having experienced a total loss from fire, she did n't realize fires do n't leave one 's computers and printers functional. \\nLooking at the number of documents Ocwen required before release of XXXX penny of the Insurance proceeds, some docs requiring notorization then discarded by Ocwen as unimportant, one ca n't imagine the burdeon placed on victims by their mortgage companies. But, I 've never heard of a mortgage company being as heartless as Ocwen. I know the documents were useless because despite everything I returned, Ocwen asked for other documents which were n't even in the original packet of docs that needed to be completed. Ocwen just wanted to hold the funds, Recently, it was newsworthy that Ocwen 's CEO stepped down from his lofty perch. I used to think my problems with Ocwen were somewhat unique, but once the news broke I learned that Ocwen had been hurting many, many others.

I am a XXXX and sometimes do n't have work in the winter months. I got behind a few months on my mortgage payments and was approved for the modification on XXXX, 2015. During this time US Bank kept sending statements for payment, assessing late fees, and making bad reports to the credit bureaus. I spoke with my representative, XXXX XXXX, about the XXXX week of XXXX to tell her I would not be able to make my XXXX payment and that the XXXX may be late. I reminded her of this when I spoke to her at the end of XXXX telling her I expected a paycheck around XXXX XXXX. I did n't get it on the XXXX and called to let her know that as soon as it arrived I was going to send in the past due amounts. I finally got the check on XXXX XXXX. I got a cashiers check for XXXX - XXXX - and XXXX and sent it. I called her the next day to let her know the check was in the mail. We signed and sent the acceptance form for the HAMP modification. About a week later, we received a letter from US Bank saying we were disqualified and not approved for the loan modification. The letter said the reason for the revocation was because the mortgage was no longer delinquent. At no time were we told that paying the past due amounts would get us eliminated from the program. I kept them well informed that I was trying to come up with the funds. Had I known, I would have kept the money and put it toward a new furnace. Ours broke last XXXX and needs to be replaced. We have been trying to keep warm this winter with only a wood stove in the basement. Sometimes it 's only XXXX degrees when we get up in the morning. We also need the roof replaced. US Bank says they will not take any responsibility for them tricking us into being disqualified. They claim the modification was figured to include the delinquency and any change to those figures nullifies the deal.

When I explained the details of the situation, they did not acknowledge the best effort I made to be current and refused to waive the fees since in their determination it was not a Wells Fargo Error. The fee is unfair, and their choice to not waive the fee was a horrible busines practice and abusive in nature as it rested on \" There is no beneift to us having to waive the fee \\'\\' Bankground Details : In XX/XX/XXXX I purchased a hot tup and took advantage of a dealer finance option that used a Wells Fargo Outdoor Solution credit card to provide XXXX months interest free financing. The total amount financed was approximately {$5500.00}. On XXXX I paid XXXX, on XX/XX/XXXX I paid {$2500.00} and knew there was a {$500.00} remaining balance. Given I had XXXX months interest free financing, I just diveded by XXXX and set my bill pay to send {$120.00} each month. On XXXX my XXXX {$120.00} payment was made. When I got a collection notice it showed the payment received but a late charge of {$25.00}. I immediately paid all the remaining principle of {$370.00} on XXXX and currently have a {$25.00} balance made exclusively of the fee. When I contacted Wells Fargo at XXXX they transferred me. The rep I spoke to spoke to his supervisor XXXX times about my situation and XXXX times said he could not waive the fee even after I explained the situation. When I asked to file a complaint, the rep was n\\'t aware of anyway to file a complaint. He offered for me to speak with his supervisor. I spoke with supervisor \" XXXX \\'\\' who said she would file a payment dispute. She continued to say they would not waive the fee as Wells Fargo did n\\'t make an error. She kept saying they send out statements and that I just need to read them. My main point of frustation and complaint is that I was paying at an accelerated rate and made a best faith attempt to not only be current but pay more than required. What I failed to realize, is even though the account has credit card access they based the minumum payment on 3.5 % of the ORIGINAL balance. My accelerated payments did n\\'t do anything to change the minimum on what I thought was a credit card account. Because I planned out my payment strategy up front, I did n\\'t look at the billing as they came and did n\\'t realize their unusual therefore to a small extent deceptive minimum payment process. When I asked how frequently they get these issues, they would not answer, which makes me think it is fairly common. I sincerely believe there is an ongoing business practice to extract fees from otherwise interest free accounts without regard to customer concern or reasonable waiver policies. They went as far to partially blame current regulatory environment for not allowing discretionary waivers. My hope with this complaint is to get the {$25.00} fee waived if possible, but more importantly to ensure Wells Fargo Financial National Bank is required to have a better complaint program than they seem to. They only took the billing dispute when I made them and did not know about any complaint program.

This subsidiary currently manages the mortgage which we are currently holding for the house. Everything seemed to be going well ; we completed all the paperwork and paid the application fee of {$570.00}. Time began to pass and we lost all communication with Popular Mortgage. I sent multiple e-mails inquiring about the loan and only got half answers. Finally in XXXX XXXX, Popular Mortgage informed us that they were denying us the re-finance loan because of a \" wording \\'\\' issue with the title. They argued that XXXX single word in the tittle invalidated the tittle, thus they were not obligated to complete the re-financing action. \\nBACKGROUND INFORMATION : The property in question is located in XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, kilometer XXXX, sector XXXX. The house was purchased in XXXX and financed through Popular Mortgage. We have been paying this mortgage for 10 years and not once have we missed a single payment, thus we are in good standing with the bank. Our credit rating is outstanding, and our debt to income ratio is low. Thus, there are no legal justifications that would preclude us from qualifying for the new loan. As a matter of fact, my wife and I just completed a re-finance loan for our current residence on XXXX XXXX, XXXX with XXXX XXXX Bank for the amount of {$280000.00}. \\nThe house was sold by XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX. The house was built in XXXX and it included a total of XXXX square meters.

The XXXX, district of XXXX, XXXX XXXX approved the division of land on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. On XXXX XXXX XXXX, my wife and I hired a land investigator that reviewed the records in the XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, XXXX XXXX and confirmed that the request for division of land had been submitted officially as follow : VOLUME : XXXX CHAPTER : XXXX TOWN : XXXX PROPERTY : XXXX INSCRIPTION : XXXX page XXXX of the purchase agreement title, the notary wrote the following statement : \" All individuals involved in this land purchase understand that the registry of this land and its current status are in good standing with the law and that under his best knowledge ( notary ) this land title study reflects the current status of the title ownership. \" Popular Mortgage stated on e-mail dated XXXX XXXX XXXX that the registry of the land in which the house was built did not comply with the statutes established by XXXX ( XXXX of XXXX ) and that the \" XXXX XXXX \\'\\' statute has not been met. This argument is irrelevant to the re-finance action, since it refers to a directive to annex the plot of XXXX square meters to the plot of land annexed to it. The plot of land in which the house rests ( XXXX square meters ) is registered legally in XXXX as verified by XXXX XXXX XXXX, title investigator, who was hired by both my wife and I to verify the land registration in question. \\nBOTTOM LINE:1.

From the beginning of the conversation, XXXX took a very confrontational and demeaning tone as she attempted to \" scold me \\'\\' for failing to answer her multiple calls from XXXX. I informed XXXX that, of course, I had no way of knowing the calls were coming from her and that in any event, I do n\\'t answer calls from XXXX unless a voicemail is left. After informing XXXX not to speak to me in the manner she was speaking to me in, the conversation moved to the issue of the debt I owe to a former apartment complex. The initial balance XXXX provided me with was {$3500.00} and she immediately proceeded to ask me ( in a very rude and unprofessional tone ) how I wanted to pay the debt this month. I told her that I needed to first know what the breakdown of charges were. I feel that prior to asking me for a method of payment after providing me with the balance owed, XXXX should have first given me the breakdown of charges so that I could determine whether I needed to dispute any of them. XXXX seemed to take issue with the fact that I asked her to provide me with the breakdown of charges prior to giving her a method of payment, and she then proceeded to raise her voice and become extremely belligerent as I told her that the balance seemed high given that I should only owe 2 months of rent per the apartment complex \\'s policy ( I had already spoken with the management at the complex ). I attempted to inform XXXX that if she simply provided me with the breakdown of charges, there would be no need to argue because I could then confirm that I was charged in accordance with Texas law. After several attempts, XXXX finally provided me with the breakdown of charges. She then proceeded to rudely attempt to explain to me that the law did n\\'t matter, that she had seen plenty of apartment complexes charge more than what I was being charged and that she had no idea why I was upset since I had obviously been given a break by the complex. I informed XXXX that the reason for my inquiry was not relevant ; the only concern she should have is that I have a right to inquire into the specifics of my debt and the specific reasons behind the charges. XXXX again told me that she had never seen someone argue about being charged less than what they owe and that she did n\\'t understand why I was n\\'t being charged the entire lease amount but that she was going to call the apartment complex and \" find out why. \\'\\' I believed this to be some attempt at a veiled threat and at this point I informed XXXX that she could call the complex if she wished but that the billed amount would likely stand due to Texas \\'s landlords \\' duty to mitigate damages from broken leases. XXXX continued to attempt to debate the law with me, finally prompting me to ask her if she was a lawyer. At this point, I had enough of XXXX \\'s condescending and demeaning tone as well as her multiple attempts to tell me what my rights were in a state which she likely has absolutely no knowledge of the law. I asked XXXX multiple times to speak with someone else and she told me several times that \" no one in her office wanted to deal with me. \\'\\' Again, floored by her unprofessionalism and disrespect, I finally hung up the phone and called back to speak with a manager. he told me that I would have to speak with XXXX to set up payment arrangements. After being transferred, XXXX continued to be rude, prompting me to ask her if she took issue with me personally. She ignored the question and then told me that I would need to attempt to get a loan before I could set up payment arrangements. I asked her if that was a legal requirement or a policy of her company \\'s, and she told me that was none of my business as if I had no right to ask. \\n',\n"," 'The CFPB resolved an issue for me with a XXXX credit card.

This XXXX incident has resulted in me beginning procedures to close all of my BOA accounts, not just my credit card. On XXXX XXXX I had great difficulty ordering a product on-line using my BOA credit card. After several failed attempts to pay with my card I called BOA. They told me that their fraud detection capabilities flagged my card and they would need to validate my attempted purchase before allowing it to go through. I was shocked, since I was actually using BOAs 'ShopSafe ' capability which should clearly indicate to even the most primitive software that it could not be fraudulent activity. Also disturbing, was that after each attempt to authorize payment I would receive an alert on my mobile device indicating a successful payment. After working with customer service we were able to authorize the purchase. I was actually able to see the purchase as a pending transaction on the BOA website. Unfortunately, after nearly XXXX, the pending status never changed, and there was no shipment notification from the merchant. I actually called the merchant inquiring as to why they were not shipping my item. They informed me that they have been trying to finalize the authorization with BOA, but failed each time. On XXXX XXXX I set up a conference call with BOA and the merchant. We tried repeatedly to remove the totally erroneous 'fraud detection block ' but to no avail. During these attempts, the pending status of my earlier attempt disappeared! In the end, I needed to hang up with the BOA associate and complete my purchase with an American Express card. The associate on the phone indicated that because I bought a juice in XXXX during the morning, but was attempting to make a web purchase with a company in Minnesota in the afternoon, I likely caused a fraud alert to lock my card! \\nThere are XXXX upsetting aspects to this : The XXXX is that BOAs credit card software is disjointed, primitive, and functional only if all variables and circumstances are pristine. Even the slightest digression from a normal credit card event ( like an XXXX resident buying a juice in the morning and then using the internet to order an item out of state ) causes their systems to fail. XXXX, none ( none! ) of the other credit cards I own have ever cancelled themselves without notice ( my previous complaint to cfpb ) or blocked my card so thoroughly that even the issuing agency could not unlock it! This indicates that BOA has chosen to allow the client experience to suffer immeasurably rather than absorb unfortunate, but normal losses from credit card fraud. I can not be the only customer being inconvenienced. The thought of being overseas on vacation, or in an emergency situation and dependent on my BOA credit card is now a situation I must mitigate immediately by ending my relationship with BOA. \\n\",\n"," 'Called this work related phone number after being told that this was for work purposes only and a personal number was given to them. \\n',\n"," 'I asked them to verify the debt and they sent me a printout of a paper showing the amount they are saying I owe to the credit bureaus.

I put down {$200000.00} approximately and took some bad advice and took interest only loan for {$370000.00} approximately with a 10-yr interest only period. That loan was eventually sold and sold again and is now owned by XXXX and serviced by OCWEN. The rate on the loan is 6.5 %. The value of my home is now approximately {$300000.00} to {$350000.00}. \\nI have been trying for years to refinance, but because XXXX or XXXX XXXX does NOT own my loan, I am NOT eligible for HARP, which would allow me to refinance above 100 % loan-to-value and NOT charge me mortgage insurance because of what happened in the real estate market with the financial crisis. XXXX participates with HAMP, which is the MODIFICATION program portion sponsored by the government. My income has also declined so that I can not qualify even with mortgage insurance. \\nI have applied XXXX to be modified, but OCWEN has denied me XXXX because I am not \" delinquent \\'\\' according to the INVESTOR \\'s ( XXXX ) standards and each time they have offered to help me with a short sale. I have always paid my mortgage on time, even though according to qualifying standards I do n\\'t really qualify! My wife and I are hard workers and we believe in paying for our obligations. \\nI want to keep my family in our house. I really just want to get a refinance to make the loan a 30-yr loan at the current rate because this loan will now amortize this XXXX for 20 YEARS when the interest only period runs out. \\nWhen they told me I was not delinquent on the XXXX modification request, I had a hard month and became late on the payment, so I re-applied and they denied me again ; I called OCWEN and persisted to speak with a relationship manager who still DID NOT KNOW the details of my file but who finally said you must be 89 days delinquent in order to qualify. This allows them to be one day away from putting a notice of default and a foreclosure notice on your property. That allows them to slow down their paperwork so that you can not have any control and be at their mercy for a foreclosure. \\nOCWEN is helping XXXX get rid of loans they do n\\'t want. I have lost {$200000.00} in equity ( and CASH that I put ) in my home and I just want to have a reasonable payment with a regular loan. I have paid my loan consistently for ten years. I am not asking anyone really to forgive any of my principal ; I wrote that on my modification request. I just want a new 30-year loan. Because I do not have a XXXX or XXXX XXXX loan I can not get a refinance, EVEN WITH mortgage insurance. \\n\\nOCWEN is being unfair by not offering me a modification without being late for 89 days -- that way they are able to get rid of my loan because they will have a notice of default and then I ca n\\'t control the situation and they will not accept a payment to bring the loan current OCWEN is trying to get rid of certain loans for XXXX by denying me a modification even though I would qualify for a modification because my income is low BUT instead they keep offering me help in doing a short sale. \\nI can only guess that maybe they are doing this because I live in a certain area and have a certain surname ( XXXX )? \\nWhy would I be denied a modification otherwise if I qualify for it? Under the GOVERNMENT rules for HAMP, you do NOT have to be delinquent. \\nALL I WANT IS A NEW 30-YR FIXED RATE LOAN LIKE XXXX OF OTHERS IF NOT XXXX HAVE GOTTEN THROUGH THE HARP PROGRAM WITHOUT PMI. \\nXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX ( I am writing this with the assistance of a financially helpful friend, XXXX XXXX ) \\n',\n"," 'Wells Fargo canceled my credit card and raised my interest rate despite that I paid my account on time and paid more than the minimum amount each month.

After stating she could only provide XXXX XXXX hour massages back to back starting at XXXX and again at XXXX, I told her that we would only need XXXX appointment then. A friend and I were on a ski vacation together and did n\\'t want to take up that much time in our evening waiting around.

Her web site has the cost of the XXXX minute massage as being {$65.00}. The industry standard provides a tip after service is completed. XXXX asked me what % of a tip I wished to provide that would be added to the cost of the massage. While I thought it rather strange to be forced into defining a tip amount in advance of services, I felt obligated to agree to the standard 15 %. XXXX never disclosed the total dollar amount that she was charging my American Express Card.

She did provide instructions about a change room where I would find a robe and place for my clothing. I went the appointment at XXXX and received a XXXX minute massage as requested.

We called XXXX the very next morning to address the issue of the overcharge. She denies ever being told that we changed the request from the original XXXX XXXX minute simultaneous massages to only XXXX XXXX minute massage.

XXXX provided AMEX a receipt dated XXXX/XXXX/15 at XXXX where she signed \" per XXXX \\'\\' in the customer signature line.

AMEX provided me a copy of the forged signature that XXXX is claiming was signed by me.

Since I have had issues of this matter in the past with this company. Agent said, the company received payment from my bank on XXXX in the amount of {$4000.00}, but Company declined to accept my payment. I asked why, they said that the update shows there were XXXX declined payments for the last six months, so now they want me to send cashier check or make payments through XXXX XXXX. \\nI made a complaint about six months ago that the system they have is having issues in accepting payments online, but they replied that it was me that was inputting the information incorrectly ; I totally disagreed because I have XXXX accounts, and my other account I have no issues ; however, I decided to make this payment directly from my own personal bank account without using OCWEN online payment system needless to say I do n't trust. Even in those circumstances that we were back and forth trying to solve the issue of non-acceptance of payment by this company online service, I paid my full amount without being late within the 15 day grace period.

I questioned the agent, why did n't OCWEN notified me in advance of this change? At the writing of this complaint I still have n't received such letter which supposedly went out on XXXX XXXX, 2015.

Furthermore Online Banks do n't issue a check if funds are not there to substantiate a payment. It 's not like I am writing the check myself. It 's unfair that I was not notified at least a month in advance of policy changes here, now I am stuck with making payments and incurring extra costs to satisfy their choice of last minute policy change ; I tried at all costs to explain to the company that there 's something wrong with the online payment system.

If you had wanted your money that bad you could have contacted me and I would have told you what the problem was but no you did what you wanted to do to ruin me. I am very disappointed in what you did to my Bank account but what do you care the account was not yours. You ca n't get paid like that because the fees the Bank charged went to the Bank and not to you. This is why you did n't get any money because you were trying to be smart and trying to hurt me, well you did a very good job of ruining my credit with the Bank. Now you ca n't get any money now. This was not the way a Company suppose to handle situations like this. You do n't try to hurt Customers by doing this. All you have done was hurt your selves by running charges up on me and this caused you not to get your money, this was not smart at all but I guest you thought it was smart but it did not work out the way you wanted it to work. I will let everyone know what you did so they can be aware of your Company. No one needs this kind of action. This was not the professional way to get your money. Hurting Customers is not handle this way. Arrangements is the answer. I will let everyone know what you did to me to they can be aware of your tactics. This is not smart nor is it legal to do what you did to my Bank account I do n't care if I owed you a {$1000.00} dollars this was not the proper way to handle this situation. It was wrong what you did but I will tell everyone how you operate when it comes to borrowing money from you. You should be held liable for your actions. I paid out more money than what I owed you this was unprofessional on your part. All you needed to do was call me and we could have set up some type of arrangements but no you had to caused my account to be closed. I assume you thought this was smart but it was n't, all you did was hurt your selves. Everyone will know what you did because I will spill it to every XXXX and they will know. The every day phone calls was unprofessional as well. I would have made arrangements to pay you but no you ran your debit through my account every single day until you lost out on your money, this could have been your money but no you was being smart well at least you thought you were being smart. Now you have to get {$4.00} or {$5.00} dollars a month for as long as it take to pay you. I had not plan on doing this but you caused all of this by the fees the Bank was charging me every day your debit came through my account. This is all your fault. I never would have done this but you made me do this by trying to be smart by running your debit through my account every single day. Now you have to suffer like me until I can pay you your money. I feel I owe you nothing because of all the money you caused me to have to pay my Bank. The money I had to pay the bank was just ridiculous it made no sense for you to run your debit through my account like this but this is what you wanted to do so suffer like me. \\n\",\n"," 'Guaranteed Rate, Inc., \" originated \\'\\' a loan on our home XXXX/XXXX/XXXX.

Suddenly, after we sent the servicer, XXXX XXXX, a QWR on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, GRI \" assigned \\'\\' the mortgage-via MERS, who has no standing in Nevada-XXXX XXXX XXXX. The assignment was supposed to go into a XXXX, was way too late and not allowed even if it had n\\'t been late. Either they lied about having an interest in the note, then assigned it illegally and late, or they told the truth about the note, and allowed XXXX to receive 2.5 years of mortgage payments and threaten foreclosure ( on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) when they had no authorization to do so. Also, they purported to be the actual lender, whereas the MERS report shows them as the servicer, nor di did they inform us that XXXX Bank was the lender, so they committed fraud from the very beginning. They also did not deposit the note into the trust as is required by the PSA agreement for XXXX. Furthermore, we sent GRI a Letter of Rescission on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. They owe us either the XXXX mortgage payments and/or the closing costs. Another clause in the DOT : BORROWER COVENANTS that Borrower is lawfully seised of the estate hereby conveyed and has the right to mortgage, grant and convey the Property and that the Property is unencumbered, except for encumbrances of record.

I messed up my grades and lost some scholarships but continued my degree, financing with student loans, federal and private. After graduating, I discovered that they had been sold across the country and I was ineligible to consolidate them as my \" income did n\\'t meet criteria. \\'\\' I began to pay on the student loans and have had several slight issues that were easily and readily remedied. Then, XXXX of my loan companies, XXXX XXXX, sold all of my loan portfolio that was with them to Navient. My parents, in an attempt to help me pay down my student loans had agreed to pay off my highest interest loan ( a loan with 14.25 % interest, compounded daily ). They made an initial payment to make certain that it would be processed properly, of {$500.00}, on said loan. That payment ( plus my payment for the month ), processed properly and was applied towards the loan which they determined, the XXXX with 14.25 % interest. Here \\'s where things took a turn for the worse. They made another payment of {$8500.00} towards that same loan, making certain to notate that they wished it to go towards the loan at 14.25 % interest. According to their website, it showed that I now owed something near {$400.00} remaining on that loan. I continued to check their website, to verify that it would stay processed properly for almost a week. The first day I did n\\'t check is when that payment ( the second, {$8500.00} payment ) got reallocated towards all of the loans in my portfolio, according to some matrix that no one can explain to me. I did n\\'t catch this until I logged in in XXXX to make a payment. I noted the difference and was on the phone with Navient within the week asking them to reapply the {$8500.00} payment solely to the loan with 14.25 %. Easily done, they assured me, and told me to check back within the week. I checked back, and sure enough, they had reapplied the {$8500.00} payment towards the 14.25 % loan, but now they had taken away the {$500.00} payment and reprocessed it towards all my loans, and the loan, which, when initial payments were made, showed less than {$500.00} left on the principal, now showed over {$1000.00}. Since then, I have talked to numerous associates at Navient and tried to explain the situation to them, and a variety of assurances and civility have been shown me, but nothing has changed in the standing of that loan for all the talking that I do with Navient. They have had my loans for 3 months, and they have been messed up for 3 months. My parents are trying to get a payoff quote to pay off the remaining balance, but it should n\\'t be over {$1000.00}, it should be closer to {$500.00}. I have been put on hold for over an hour before they \\'ve hung up on me and I \\'ve been asked to call back and I \\'ve been told that the \" line to the department who reapplies loans is down \\'\\' for Navient, and all of these have led this issue to continue, and I \\'ve been told that it continues to accrue interest, compounded DAILY, while this issue continues to go unresolved. \\n',\n"," 'The last payment I \\'ve sent out to pay my mortgage with Chase was \" not received \\'\\'.

My account was \"referred\" to Chase\\'s foreclosure department within the same month that the sale closed as a Short Sale.  Months before - Chase had already agreed to the Short Sale and the sale was in process per Chase\\'s agreement.  Per the FTC\\'s website - a short sale and a foreclosure are not to be treated the same.  My loan closed as a short sale, the bank never had or took possess of my home and there was never a XXXX.  So why is Chase allowed to continue to report my Short Sale to all XXXX credit bureaus in a manner that causes them to threat the short sale as a foreclosure for reporting purposes, keeping it on my credit for 7 years and thereby damaging my entire credit rating and holding me hostage from a financial perspective?  I have been reporting this to the CFPB for a year and you\\'ve done nothing to to enforce your own mandates regarding Short sales that are stated on the FTC website.  I\\'ve also spoken to an attorney about taking action against Chase.  My attorney advised me that a case would be a losing proposition given that the CFPB has not demanded or published any regulations requiring the banks and the credit bureaus to properly treat short sales as short sales versus a foreclosure.  So why then do you have the information on the FTC website at all if consumers can not rely on it and the banks and credit bureaus are not Required to adhere to it?  I negotiated a short sale with Chase and the transaction closed in a short sale - I\\'ve submitted volumes of documents to your agency evidencing that and Chase does not disagree that the sale closed as a short sale.  However, despite the fact that Chase agreed to a short sale they still referred my property to foreclosure the same month that the sale was closing and now have been allowed to damage my credit by erroneously reporting a short sale as a foreclosure and the credit bureaus are treating it as such.  Until the CFPB requires the credit bureaus and the banks to follow the standard articulated by the FTC and distinguish between the XXXX, consumers like myself will continue to be held hostage by the banks and unfairly punished for something that did not happen.  The CFPB needs to address its lack of enforcement in this area or stop taking mortgage complaints regarding short sale reporting - this is worse than the banks to have clearly articulated mandates for the banks and credit bureaus to follow and then not enforcing them at the consumers expense - so annoyed and disappointed!',\n"," \"Received a letter from XXXX XXXX stating that I owe them for a collection for PayPal.

Their web sit does not allow you to reset a pin ( if the web site did work which it does not ). When you contact their service representative, he is insulting and unhelpful. He implies it is your fault for not being able to use their system properly. Capital One sends information about how easy it is to pay your bill, but their system is not usable. There is no way to pay your bill. I have just now received a letter from them that we can pay be online, by phone, and by mail.

Those included : my paystubs from XXXX years ago, all my bank and investment account statements back from 6 months ago ( totally more than XXXX of them ), explanation on every {$1000.00} dollar transfer between my bank accounts, and most ridiculously, proof of residence for some place I lived more than 15 years ago. I have also been asked for my intention for every my credit bureau inquiry in the past year. Overall, it seemed that they were conducting a criminal investigation instead of underwriting a loan. However, it became evident that they never looked at all the documents, as they had asked for some of them repeatedly, sometimes XXXX times during the process. \\n\\nOverall I have submitted more than XXXX pieces of documents and it cost me dozens of hours to prepare them. I am relatively financial savvy and very careful about documentation, and even so, the process took almost XXXX months and we nearly missed the closing date. During the XXXX months I have repeatedly asked to talk to the underwriter for her rationale to ask for so much documentation, but never got a response other than more requests. \\n\\nIn my opinion, whether intentional from Wells Fargo or not, this cumbersome underwriting process has created a barrier for applicants with good risk profile to qualify for mortgages. It will be up to CPFB to decide, whether this practice is across the board, or only targets minority customers like myself. \\n\\nI have filed a complaint directly with Wells Fargo, but only received a plain vanilla response letter saying they have done nothing wrong. This was totally unsatisfactory and therefore I am filing this complaint to CFPB. \\n',\n"," 'To whom it may concern, I called Sallie Mae to proactively figure out a rate reduction plan that would help me pay less per month with a lower interest rate due to increasing living expenses.

I was very disappointed, and advised the lady that I will be reporting this unethical behavior to your esteemed agency.

Earlier this year my husband and I were really struggling due to lose of income. Along with the stress of low income i had a sister sick with XXXX, a mother suffering with what could posablly be XXXX, and a mother in law who is both physicaly and mentally XXXX who also lived XXXX to XXXX hours away depending on traffic who needs us up there quite often not to mention my husbands an only child. I also work full time in a very demanding job with an equally demanding boss so between my streeful job and personnel life i was finding it difficult to keep up and remember absolutely everything and knowing at the time I was only able to afford to make the minimum payment on both credit card accounts i took the initiative to call capital one and set it up to were they just automatically took out the minimum due out each month on the credit cards until I could afford to do otherwise. A few months later I reseved a letter in the mail from capital one stating that I had not paid on my accounts in months and they were about to close me out. In shock and upset I called capital one only to find out that they had already closed out both of my accounts. I tried to explain to them that I had spoken to XXXX of there represenitives and had my payments set up to be automatically taken out of my bank account each month that there must have been a horable mistake made all I got from them was my accounts have been closed out and that there was Absolutely nothing they or I could do to reopen them and nothing they could do to help me. Devistated and in tears I tried to look online for other capital one departments to call for some help with my situation but no matter what department I tried to call it always just took me back to the original department that I first talk to who refused to help me. At this point in time I have paid XXXX account off in full and current stuck making payments to an account that I ca n't no longer use and my credit score that I have worked so hard to rebuild has been greatly effected all because capital one a company who I have been a loyal customer and until this payment arrangement screw up I have always paid on time to on both credit card accounts since I got them 2 years ago refused to help or even hear me out. I will take fault in the fact that I should have paid better attention to my bank statements and made sure the money was being taken out as arranged but I do n't feel that I deserve to have both of my accounts closed out and my credit that I was working so hard to rebuild ruined over an unfortunate misunderstanding. I was n't even given the chance to plead my case even though it was there company 's screw up and did n't follow threw with our payment arrangement. I would like to have the chance to be heard and have the possibility of having my accounts reopend and to not have all my hard work be for nothing I think that 's the part that bothers me the most. At this point I feel hopeless that I will get any cooperation from capital one and pray that you can help me. \\n\",\n"," \"Bank of America, which is my own bank, took my whole XXXX check from my account to go towards a charged off auto loan.
